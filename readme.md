# ExcelXML #

**ExcelXML** is a class to generate an Excel XML formatted file.  It has routines to create a worksheet manually or from a SQL DataReader or a table in a DataSet.

## Development Requirements ##
- Visual Studio 2010, C#, .NET Framework 2.0.

## Known Issues ##
This is some pretty old code that really needs to be cleaned up, commented, and optimized.  It works and served its purpose, but I can't really recommend using this for a prolonged period in a production environment, if ever.  It would be much better to use a 3rd party tool, such as [SpreadSheetGear](http://www.spreadsheetgear.com/), to generate XML files on the fly.
